git flow basics

1.first we need to add the ssh key to our github, you can follow the next link for more info

[Adding ssh key to github](https://docs.github.com/es/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

2.Next we should create this repository, i did it with github desktop, click new repository to create one, and name it gitflow

3.We should create a new branch to this repository, you can do it with github desktop just click add new branch and name it "development"

4.Now lets make this branch into the new base branch, in github.com go to your repository gitflow, and click the little gear icon and into branches change it from main to development

5.Next, you can change the read.me file and write something in each to see you have different branches 

Esta rama es development

6. Last thing i did, was creating a new branch named "features" and edit the README file like i did last step
